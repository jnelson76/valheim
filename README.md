> # Update Information (Latest listed first)
> > ### v1.0.1
> - Up the range to 50 at the request of some that still find it too low. Any higher than this and you're whole chunk has no mist which naturally would cause some performance issues. :D
> ### v1.0.0
> - Initial Release (compatible with Mistlands only! Will not work with any earlier versions of Valheim.)`
