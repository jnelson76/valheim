# Target Portal

Lets you target any portal, instead of having to connect two portals via a tag.

If you enter a portal, a map opens and displays the position of all portals. Click one of the portal icons, to teleport to this portal.

You can still tag the portals and the tags will be displayed with the portal icon on the map.

You can toggle between different portal modes:
- Public: Everyone can target this portal
- Private: Only you can target this portal
- Group: Only group members can target this portal
- Admin: Only admins can target this portal

The group option requires the [Groups](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Groups) mod to be installed.

The admin option requires you to be an admin.

The owner of a portal changes everytime the portal mode is toggled.

Valheim fetches portals every 5 seconds, so it might take a few seconds for new portals to show up on the map.

Works with custom portals added by other mods.

For multiplayer games, this is required on the server as well.
